      list<int> l2 {11,22,44,55};
      list<string> l3 {"vishal","vikas","veen","arati"};

      **********Useful Function of list class*****
      sort()
      size()    -> check total value in the list are like example of this list ans = 4;
      push_back()
      push_front()
      pop_back()
      reverse()
      remove()  -> if you want remove a particular no, you can and if you want remove that no
                  who not do not exist , so will not effect your list
                  and if you want that number remove who no is repeated then after removing
                  all repeated not removed;
      clear()  -> clear function clear all the list;
