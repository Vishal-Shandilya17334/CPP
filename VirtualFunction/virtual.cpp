#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class vfun
{
    
};




/* do nothing function function    void fun()=0; //pure virtual function == abstract class
// if this type of function written in any class, you can't make obj of that class 
// one more point if you make virtual of any function means you want let binding of that 
function

A class containing  pure virtual function is an abstract class = Abstract class
and we can't instance of that class


why need abstract class
becaus those generic function whose contain generalies inform and we don't wnt access it 
like ex -- student, faculty, person class
