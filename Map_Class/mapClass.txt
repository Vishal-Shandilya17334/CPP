numeric array -> mean whoes array acess by index no, that is call numeric array
              or whose indexing is help of number is called numeric

associative array -> the indexing bone by name wht ever you want
                     and this associative array done help of map


*****************************map*******************************
  -> map are use to replicate (copy pase nakal krna) associative array
  -> map contain shorted key value pair, in which
     each key is unique and cannot be changed and\
     it can be inserted or deleted but cannot be altered

     key value pair  mean      ex-  want to stored student marks    so  index =student name = key, particular indeX VALUE = value


               associative Array = map
                 
                         customer no.key         customer name= value
                                100                   jitendra
                                123                   vishal
                                345                   vikas
                                171                   veena
                                388                   arati
Map Property

  -> maps always arrange its keys in shorted order
  -> in case the keys are  of string type, they are
     sorted in  dictionary order

How to create a map
                    key,value
                map<int,string> customer

                customer[100] = "vihan";
                customer[123] = "vikas";
                customer[145] = "vishal";
                customer[171] = "veena";
                customer[200] = "arati";

2 way to store data inside map-->>
 
    map<int,string> customer { {100,"vihan"},{123,"vikas"},{245,"vishal"} };
            
*********SOME use full function for manp class ******
    ->at() -> if you give it to index to at() function , it will return particular value
    -> []
    -> size() -> return how  many value inside map
    -> empty() -> check map empty of not return 0 or 1
    -> insert() -> insert data customer.insert{pair<int,string>{543,"mamta"}};
    -> clear() -> remove all data
